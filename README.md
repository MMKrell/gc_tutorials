# Graphcore Tutorials

This repository contains tutorials, feature examples and simple applications to help you learn how to use
Graphcore IPUs.

If you are interested in trying IPUs in the cloud, you can [register](https://spell.ml/graphcore) for a self-guided, free trial with Spell. Developers can run a selection of tutorials and application examples within Spell's intuitive Jupyter notebook environment.

Please note we are not currently accepting pull requests or issues on this
repository. If you are actively using this repository and want to report any issues, please raise a ticket through the Graphcore support portal: https://www.graphcore.ai/support.

The latest version of the documentation for the Poplar software stack, and other developer resources, is available at https://www.graphcore.ai/developer.

>  The code presented here requires using Poplar SDK 2.4. Please check other branches of this repository for code compatible with previous releases.

Please install and enable the Poplar SDK following the instructions in the [Getting Started guide for your IPU system](https://docs.graphcore.ai/en/latest/getting-started.html).
