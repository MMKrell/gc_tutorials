A single TensorFlow data pipeline is wrapped by an IPU infeed queue, which
serves each of the replicas concurrently as they request pipeline elements.
Replicas calculate the loss for their data elements, then calculate gradients
with respect to that loss. The replicas then synchronise and do an all-reduce on
the gradients, averaging them. By default, each gradient is reduced separately
in sequence.

The all-reduce itself is implemented as a ring all-reduce - see
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-to-all_(parallel_pattern)#Ring. If the
all-reduce is on a gradient containing G elements over N replicas, this involves
O(N) global exchanges, where each global exchange involves each replica
exchanging O(G/N) elements with its neighbour.

You can control the amount of gradients all-reduced at a time by changing the
max_cross_replica_sum_buffer_size (specified in bytes). For example, if the
buffer size is 10MB, then 10MB of gradients (at most) will be exchanged in a
single all-reduce. Note that changing this value and the number of replicas
represents an always-live vs not always-live trade off:
  - Increasing the max_cross_replica_sum_buffer_size will lead to larger
    temporary buffers in the all-reduce exchange, but fewer all-reduces overall
    and therefore less control code.
  - Increasing the number of replicas will lead to smaller temporary buffers in
    the all-reduce exchange, but more exchanges in each all-reduce and therefore
    more control code.

Some additional notes:
  - If the temporary buffers are too large, then their exchanges may start
    generating more control code than they save.
  - If your model contains a lot of trainable variables, it's strongly advised
    to consider adjusting the max_cross_replica_sum_buffer_size.
  - If a model doesn't fit with a small number of replicas due to memory spikes,
    you may find a larger number of replicas does fit.
