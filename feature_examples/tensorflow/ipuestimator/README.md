# IPUEstimator CNN example


This README describes how to run the IPUEstimator to train and evaluate a simple CNN.
## Overview

TensorFlow Estimators use a high-level TensorFlow API, which automatically handles most of the implementation details when training/evaluating a model. They are designed to be "hardware agnostic"; you do not have to change your model when running on CPUs, GPUs, TPUs or over single devices versus distributed devices. For more information about Estimators, please see https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/estimator.

## IPUEstimator

The IPUEstimator is the IPU implementation of the TensorFlow Estimator. It handles several parts of running a TensorFlow program on the IPU for you, including:

1. Scoping the model inside the `ipu.scopes.ipu_scope('/device:IPU:0')` scope;
2. Compiling the model with XLA via `ipu.ipu_compiler.compile` with an `ipu.loops.repeat` loop;
3. Creating infeeds from the datasets and, if enabled, outfeeds;
4. Configuring the IPU system;
5. Incrementing the global step counter;
6. If requested, turning replication and sharding on;
7. Generating compilation/execution reports, etc.

Normally, you give an Estimator a RunConfig to tell the Estimator how to train/evaluate the model. We extend the RunConfig class to accept an IPURunConfig, which additionally accepts an IPU config, to allow you to express the IPU-specific options you would like, while still being able to use that RunConfig with another Estimator. In these configs, you can define things such as the iterations per loop on the IPU, the replication factor, autosharding, whether or not to generate a compilation report etc.

In this example, the IPUEstimator is used to train and evaluate a simple CNN based on this [Keras CIFAR-10 example](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/1a3ee8441933fc007be6b2beb47af67998d50737/examples/cifar10_cnn.py)
## Dataset

This model uses the standard CIFAR10 Keras dataset with contains 60,000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images. It is automatically downloaded by the script.

## Quick start guide

1. Prepare the TensorFlow environment.
   Install the Poplar SDK following the Getting Started guide for your IPU system.
   Make sure to source the `enable.sh` script for Poplar and activate a Python virtualenv with 
   a TensorFlow 1 wheel from the Poplar SDK installed (use the version appropriate to your operating system and processor).
   
2. Train and test the model:

       python ipu_estimator_cnn.py

### Examples

To train the model with batch size 16, for 500 batches per IPU loop, with a learning rate of 0.001:

       python ipu_estimator_cnn.py --batch-size 16 --batches-per-step 500 --learning-rate 0.001

To test the model, loading weights from a checkpoint in a directory /path/to/ckpt:

       python ipu_estimator_cnn.py --test-only --model-dir /path/to/ckpt

To generate a compilation and execution reports, use the Poplar environment variable

       POPLAR_ENGINE_OPTIONS='{"autoReport.all":"true"}' python ipu_estimator_cnn.py --model-dir /path/to/ckpt

Running the above command will produce two tf_report directories (with timestamps in their names) containing profiling data that can be viewed with the PopVision Graph Analyser. The older timestamped directory will contain the training profile data and the newer timestamped directory will contain the evaluation profile data.

#### Options

The `ipu_estimator_cnn.py` script has a few options. Use the `-h` flag or examine the code to understand them.
