### Poplar examples

- [Advanced_example](advanced_example): This example performs a simple computation but demonstrates some of the advanced
features of Poplar (using dedicated programs for the I/O, using PopLibs, saving/reusing executables, choosing the number of IPUs...). It is a good follow-up to what is shown inside the Poplar tutorials.
- [Prefetch](prefetch): This example shows how to implement the prefetching of the input stream of a Poplar program, using a callback, in order to maximise I/O performance.
